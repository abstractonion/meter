# Stagger Animations & Debugging

Cascade entrances naturally, then verify them with slow-motion and frame-by-frame tooling.

## Stagger Animations

When multiple elements enter together, stagger their appearance. Each element animates in with a small delay after the previous one. This creates a cascading effect that feels more natural than everything appearing at once.

```css
.item {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(8px);
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out forwards;
}

.item:nth-child(1) {
  animation-delay: 0ms;
}
.item:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 50ms;
}
.item:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 100ms;
}
.item:nth-child(4) {
  animation-delay: 150ms;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Keep stagger delays short (30-80ms between items). Long delays make the interface feel slow. Stagger is decorative — never block interaction while stagger animations are playing.

## Debugging Animations

### Slow motion testing

Play animations at reduced speed to spot issues invisible at full speed. Temporarily increase duration to 2-5x normal, or use browser DevTools animation inspector to slow playback.

Things to look for in slow motion:

- Do colors transition smoothly, or do you see two distinct states overlapping?
- Does the easing feel right, or does it start/stop abruptly?
- Is the transform-origin correct, or does the element scale from the wrong point?
- Are multiple animated properties (opacity, transform, color) in sync?

### Frame-by-frame inspection

Step through animations frame by frame in Chrome DevTools (Animations panel). This reveals timing issues between coordinated properties that you cannot see at full speed.

### Test on real devices

For touch interactions (drawers, swipe gestures), test on physical devices. Connect your phone via USB, visit your local dev server by IP address, and use Safari's remote devtools. The Xcode Simulator is an alternative but real hardware is better for gesture testing.

See also: `component-craft-principles.md` for "review your work the next day", and `gestures-and-drag.md` for the touch interactions worth testing on real hardware.
